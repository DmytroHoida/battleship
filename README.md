# Battleship Game
### Starting the App
- To play the game, simply copy this repository to your computer where JVM should be installed.
- Compile the program by executing ```javac BattleshipApp.java``` (make sure you're in ```src``` directory) in the command line.
- Run the program by executing ```java BattleshipApp``` in the command line.
### Game Setup
- There'll be 3 ships that consist of 3 squares each which you would like to sink.
- They will be randomly located on 7x7 grid. Numbers start at 0 and end at 6 while letters start at 'A' and end at 'G'.
- Ships might be located vertically or horizontally.
- There'll be at least one buffer space between ships as they don't touch one another.

### How to Play
- Just take a guess by entering it in the command line when prompted (e.g. "A0" or "a0").
- If your guess is correct, you'll see it on the grid. If not, the location will disappear.
- After sinking all 3 ships, you will see how many tries you needed to sink them.

### Technologies
The source code is written in Java. This is one of my first Java projects,
and it's a part of my journey to mastering this programming language.
